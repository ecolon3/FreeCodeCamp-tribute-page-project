        <p id="img-caption">Tia started RuPaul's Drag Race on an inspired note, 
            choosing an Alan Turing-themed look for the category "UK Gay Icons." 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank" id="turing-wiki">Experts estimate</a> 
            that Turing's revolutionary codebreaking for British intelligence during the Second World War saved 
            over 14 million lives. Nonetheless, Turing later faced conviction and even forced estrogen injections because 
            he acknowledged being in a gay relationship while reporting a burglary of his home.</p>

      <p id="intro-para">Tia Kofi is the stage name of the drag queen Lawrence Bolton, who appeared on the second 
        season of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2021. The name is a play on the question, "tea or coffee?" While on the 
        show, Tia survived two lip sync battles before becoming the seventh queen eliminated. She may not have 
        brought what the judges were looking for this time, but her charming personality and self-deprecating humor 
        made a big impact on fans.</p>

        <p id="tia-quote">"I am serving you... an adequate dress... made of material that is on my body. 
            Vintage? No. Elegant? No! Still stuck on me? Just about! The judges seem vaguely amused by what is 
            happening before them, and I'm okay with that."<br><br> -Tia Kofi</p>
